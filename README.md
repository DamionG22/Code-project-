** REFACTORING**
The purpose of this repo was to clean up existing code and add "alt text" for accessibilty, without changing the existing codes fucntions.
This was achieved in several ways including 
 * Adding "alt text" to images so that when a user can't see the image alt attributes are  provided in its place.
 * Grouping css elements that provide the same function.
 * Fixing redirect links that did not function properly.
 * Renaming elements in the source code so they are semantic.
